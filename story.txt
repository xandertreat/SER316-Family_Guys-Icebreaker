As a freelance contractor, I have to goto many different places for many different businesses; my currently planned trip is to Raesfeld, Germany. 
For this trip, I have many gebaecks in my bag in case I get hungry while traveling.
Ahead of me, I have encountered some knights guarding a schloss.
The knights eyed my Porsche car as I approached them.
I get in my car and drive away as fast as lightning
But this car is a BMW, so it's polluting like crazy and it broke down, so I guess I'll sell my house now...
I'll probably also liquidate my Bratwurst business to help pay for it.
With the extra money after repairing the BMW, I'll go to the animal shelter and get myself a hund.
I hope the hund likes apfelkuchen as much as I do.
Or else i will go to Flughafen Berlin and leave him behind.
While driving to the Berlin Flughafen, my BMW broke down again.
I may have liquidated my Bratwurst business, but I still have my apfelkuchen business which is very wettbewerbsfaehig. If the hund don't like it, he's out >:(
